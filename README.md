--> Problem Statement : To eradicate the shortage of supply and misuse of vaccines and also to make sure that all the manufactured vaccines are 
                        supplied properly to local health care and everyone in need gets one without any hassle. Also, one of the main uses of this 
                        project is to manage the supply and demand of vaccines. There are manufacturers, providers, distributors , local health care , 
                        and people involved in the cycle.

--> Solution : Created an application to manage the distribution of vaccines to local health departments and maintain records of the same.

--> Key Features : 

1.Maintaining the supply and demand of vaccines throughout the system.
2.In accordance with vaccine demand, the CDC purchases vaccines from manufacturers and keeps them in distributor warehouses.
3.Orders can be made by clinics connected to the providers.
4.Following provider approval, clinic orders are subject to a series of approvals from the Local Health Department (LHD) and from LHD to CDC.
5.Via the CDC, vaccination requests are accepted or rejected based on the state's population.
6.In accordance with the vaccines in the inventory, the Distributor ships the vaccines to the appropriate locations after the Order is approved.
7.Vaccines are kept in stock at the designated sites after delivery.
8.After immunisation, the patient's status is recorded in a table for the clinic's and patient's future use.
9.A chief medical officer will track all vaccine distribution statistics down to the state, city, and provider level based on the total number of 
  vaccines distributed.
10.To change the credentials for a person, the system administrator does NOT need to approve any requests.
11.Without the system administrator's involvement, clinics can register new patients.
